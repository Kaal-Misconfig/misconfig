An analysis is a detailed examination of an event or process, describing its origin and impact, that with the help of certain precautions and actions, can be triggered to support or prevent future occurrences.

|**Analysis Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Descriptive`|Descriptive analysis is essential in any data analysis. On the one hand, it describes a data set based on individual characteristics. It helps to detect possible errors in data collection or outliers in the data set.|
|`Diagnostic`|Diagnostic analysis clarifies conditions' causes, effects, and interactions. Doing so provides insights that are obtained through correlations and interpretation. We must take a backward-looking view, similar to descriptive analysis, with the subtle difference that we try to find reasons for events and developments.|
|`Predictive`|By evaluating historical and current data, predictive analysis creates a predictive model for future probabilities. Based on the results of descriptive and diagnostic analyses, this method of data analysis makes it possible to identify trends, detect deviations from expected values at an early stage, and predict future occurrences as accurately as possible.|
|`Prescriptive`|Prescriptive analytics aims to narrow down what actions to take to eliminate or prevent a future problem or trigger a specific activity or process.|

However, it is essential to ask `precise questions` and remember what we `know` and `do not know`. At this point, we must first ask ourselves what we `see` and what we actually `have`, because what we see is not the same as what we have:

- a `TCP` port `2121`. - `TCP` already means that this service is `connection-oriented`.
    
- Is this a `standard` port? - `No`, because these are between `0-1023`, aka well-known or [system ports](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)
    
- Are there any numbers in this `port number` that look `familiar`? - `Yes`, `TCP` port `21` (`FTP`). From our experience, we will get to know many standard ports and their services, which administrators often try to disguise, but often use "easy to remember" alternatives.
    

Based on our guess, we can try to connect to the service using `Netcat` or an `FTP` client and try to establish a connection to confirm or disprove our guess.

While connecting to the service, we noticed that the connection took longer than usual (about 15 seconds). There are some services whose connection speed, or response time, can be configured. Now that we know that an FTP server is running on this port, we can deduce the origin of our "failed" scan. We could confirm this again by specifying the minimum `probe round trip time` (`--min-rtt-timeout`) in Nmap to 15 or 20 seconds and rerunning the scan.
