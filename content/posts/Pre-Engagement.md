The entire pre-engagement process consists of three essential components:

1. Scoping questionnaire
    
2. Pre-engagement meeting
    
3. Kick-off meeting
    

Before any of these can be discussed in detail, a `Non-Disclosure Agreement` (`NDA`) must be signed by all parties. There are several types of NDAs:

|**Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Unilateral NDA`|This type of NDA obligates only one party to maintain confidentiality and allows the other party to share the information received with third parties.|
|`Bilateral NDA`|In this type, both parties are obligated to keep the resulting and acquired information confidential. This is the most common type of NDA that protects the work of penetration testers.|
|`Multilateral NDA`|Multilateral NDA is a commitment to confidentiality by more than two parties. If we conduct a penetration test for a cooperative network, all parties responsible and involved must sign this document.|
