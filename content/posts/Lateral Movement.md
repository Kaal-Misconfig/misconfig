In this stage, we want to test how far we can move manually in the entire network and what vulnerabilities we can find from the internal perspective that might be exploited. In doing so, we will again run through several phases:

1. Pivoting
2. Evasive Testing
3. Information Gathering
4. Vulnerability Assessment
5. (Privilege) Exploitation
6. Post-Exploitation
