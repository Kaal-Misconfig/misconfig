## Prioritization of Possible Attacks

Once we have found one or two vulnerabilities during the `Vulnerability Assessment` stage that we can apply to our target network/system, we can prioritize those attacks. Which of those attacks we prioritize higher than the others depends on the following factors:

- Probability of Success
- Complexity
- Probability of Damage

#### Prioritization Example

|**Factor**|**Points**|**Remote File Inclusion**|**Buffer Overflow**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1. Probability of Success|`10`|10|8|
|2. Complexity - Easy|`5`|4|0|
|3. Complexity - Medium|`3`|0|3|
|4. Complexity - Hard|`1`|0|0|
|5. Probability of Damage|`-5`|0|-5|
|**Summary**|`max. 15`|14|6|

Based on the above example, we would prefer the `remote file inclusion` attack. It is easy to prepare and execute and should not cause any damage if approached carefully.
