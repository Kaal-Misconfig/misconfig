They’re powerful, but if not managed well, they can accidentally give too much access, which attackers love to abuse. Companies often have both built-in and custom groups. Overtime, too many groups can cause confusion and lead to unintended access, so it’s important to regularly audit group memberships and permissions. Difference Between Groups and OUs Groups: Used to assign permissions OUs: Used to organize and manage users, computers and groups. You can apply policies or delegate control without giving full admin rights. Types of Groups Groups in AD have two fundamental characteristics: type and scope. the group type defines the groups’s purpose, while the group scope shows how the group can be used within the domain or forest. Group Types Security Groups -\u003e The security groups type is primarily for ease of assigning permissions and rights to a collection of users instead of one at a time. They simplify management and reduce overhead when assigning permissions and rights for a given resource. All users added to a security group will inherit any permissions assigned to the group, making it easier to move users in and out of groups while leaving the group’s permissions unchanged.\nDistribution Groups -\u003e The distribution groups type is used by email applications such as Microsoft Exchange to distribute messages to group members. they function much like mailing lists and allow for auto-adding emails in the “To” field when creating an email in Microsoft Outlook. this type of group cannot be used to assign permission to resources in a Domain environment.\nGroup Scopes Domain Local Groups -\u003e Domain Local groups can only be used to manage permissions to domain resources in the domain where it was created. Local Groups cannot be used in other domains but CAN contain users from other domains. Local groups can be nested into other local groups but not within global groups.\nGlobal Group Universal Group -\u003e Universal groups in AD are used when you need to manage access across multiple domains in the same forest. They can include from users any domain and give access to any resource in the forest. This groups are stored in GC (Global Catalog), so changes to them causes forest-wide replication, meaning the update gets sent to all domains.\nExample Get-ADGroup -Filter * | select samaccountname, groupscope samaccountname groupscope -------------- ---------- Administrators DomainLocal Users DomainLocal Guests DomainLocal Print Operators DomainLocal Backup Operators DomainLocal Replicator DomainLocal Remote Desktop Users DomainLocal Network Configuration Operators DomainLocal Distributed COM Users DomainLocal IIS_IUSRS DomainLocal Cryptographic Operators DomainLocal Event Log Readers DomainLocal Certificate Service DCOM Access DomainLocal RDS Remote Access Servers DomainLocal RDS Endpoint Servers DomainLocal RDS Management Servers DomainLocal Hyper-V Administrators DomainLocal Access Control Assistance Operators DomainLocal Remote Management Users DomainLocal Storage Replica Administrators DomainLocal Domain Computers Global Domain Controllers Global Schema Admins Universal Enterprise Admins Universal Cert Publishers DomainLocal Domain Admins Global Domain Users Global Domain Guests Global NOTE A Global Group can only be converted into Universal Group if it is NOT part of another Global Group A Domain Local Group can only be converted to a Universal Group if the Domain Local Group does NOT contain any other domain local groups as members. A universal group can be converted to a Domain Local Group without any restrictions. A Universal Group can only be converted to a Global Group if it does NOT contain any other Universal Groups as Members Built-In Vs Custom Groups When a new domain is created in AD, several built-in security groups are automatically made. These groups usually have a Domain Local scope and are used for specific admin tasks. You can’t nest groups inside these built-in ones, only user accounts can be added. Organizations usually create their own custom groups and new services like Microsoft Exchange can also automatically add new privileged groups to AD. If these aren’t reviewed and managed properly, attackers can use them to gain high-level access. Nested Group Membership In AD, Groups can be nested, So if User A is in Group 1, and Group 1 is in Group 2, User A gets the permissions of Group 2, even if not directly added to it. Nested groups can unintentionally give away powerful access. Use BloodHound to visualize and detect these hidden paths, it’s crucial for both pentesters and sysadmins. Important Group Attributes cn: Common-Name is the name of the group in AD DS. member: Which user, group and contact objects are member of the group. groupType: An integer that specifies the group type and scope memberOf: A listing of any groups that contain the group as a member. objectSID: This is the security identifier or SID of the group, which is the unique value used to identify the group as a security principal.
